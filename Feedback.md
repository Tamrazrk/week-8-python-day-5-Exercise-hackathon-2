Hello Tamar,

Here's my feedback on your project. I've included some points for preservation and some points for improvement. I hope you find it helpful.

### Points for Improvement
1. **Print Statements**: There are `print` statements, possibly left from debugging, in the `get_queryset` method of `TaskListCreateView`. This should be removed or replaced with logging for production.

2. **DRY Code**: The `permission_classes` are duplicated in both `TaskListCreateView` and `TaskRetrieveUpdateDestroyView`. Consider moving common logic into a base class.

3. **Error Handling**: There's no explicit error handling in the API views or in the front-end JavaScript. What happens if a task can't be deleted, or the page fails to load?

4. **Comments and Docstrings**: While the code is generally clean, it would benefit from some inline comments and function/class docstrings explaining the logic and decision-making process behind the code.

5. **Direct DOM Manipulation**: In the frontend code, the tasks are directly inserted into the DOM. This approach could be error-prone. It might be better to use a more structured way to manage the DOM, like React or Vue.

6. **Frontend Pagination**: The `fetchTasks` function seems to deal with pagination, but there's no UI controls for moving between pages.

### Points for Preservation
1. **Separation of Concerns**: The code is well-organized into models, views, serializers, forms, and signals. This makes it easier to navigate.

2. **RESTful API Design**: The use of Django's generic views for RESTful API endpoints is a good practice.

3. **Code Reusability**: The `get_queryset` method ensures that users can only see and modify their own tasks, which is a great reusable piece of logic.

4. **Clear Data Models**: The `Task` and `Notification` models are well-designed, with appropriate fields and methods for each.

5. **Method Overriding**: Overriding the `perform_create` method to assign the user to a task is a good usage of Django REST Framework's capabilities.

6. **Frontend Functionality**: The JavaScript code is organized well into functions, each of which has a single responsibility.

### Conclusion
Great job on the project, Tamar! The separation of concerns and clear data models are particularly impressive. However, let's refine it further. Clean up the debugging traces and consider more robust error handling for edge cases. Also, think about adding inline comments and docstrings for better readability. On the frontend side, explore more structured ways to manage the DOM, perhaps using a library like React. Keep up the good work!
